Welcome to the repository for my personal website, where I document my learning paths and showcase my IT projects. This website is built using Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator. As a student in the IT field, I use this platform to share my journey, projects, and experiences in the world of technology.

- Learning Paths: Explore my learning paths as I progress through my IT studies.
- Projects: Check out the various IT projects I've worked on, from coding exercises to personal initiatives.
- Blog: Read my blog posts where I share insights, tips, and reflections on my learning journey.

This website serves as a digital portfolio and learning log for my IT career. I aim to share my knowledge, experiences, and projects with the community while documenting my learning paths. Whether you're a fellow student, a seasoned professional, or just curious about my journey, you'll find valuable content here.
