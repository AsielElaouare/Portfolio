Currently, I am enrolled in studies at Inholland. It's a dynamic period of my educational journey, where I'm delving into the diverse realms of Information Technology. Inholland provides a rich learning environment, and I'm excited to share my experiences and discoveries as I navigate through my courses and projects. Stay tuned for more updates on my educational adventure at Inholland!
