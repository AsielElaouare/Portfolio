  - title: "NutrientQuery"
    image: ""
    content:  "The NutrientQuery project is a simple tool that helps users get nutritional information about the food they input. It uses an API key to connect to a database of nutritional data. Users provide information about the food they're interested in, and the project fetches relevant nutritional details using the API key. It's a handy way for people to quickly access information about the nutrients in their food choices. In addition to providing nutritional information, the NutrientQuery project goes the extra mile by presenting the data in a visually accessible way. After fetching the nutrient details, the project creates a pie chart to help users better understand the distribution of nutrients in the food. This visual representation makes it easier for users to grasp the proportion of different nutrients present in their selected food item. <br> <div class='badge-container'> [![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bootstrap-563D7C?style=for-the-badge&logo=bootstrap&logoColor=white)](https://getbootstrap.com/)[![jQuery](https://img.shields.io/badge/jQuery-0769AD?style=for-the-badge&logo=jquery&logoColor=white)](https://jquery.com/) [![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) [![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [![Netlify Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Netlify%20Status-Success-00C7B7?style=for-the-badge&logo=netlify&logoColor=white)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/nutrient-query/deploys) </div>"
