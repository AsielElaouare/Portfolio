    image: "/images/projectsPics/eurobird.png"
    content:  "Currently working to build a full banking application completely from scratch. We're using the Spring framework as the backbone, along with key dependencies like Lombok (to cut down on boilerplate code), JPA (for managing our database interactions), and Spring Web to set up a RESTful API. For our database, we're using H2 — an in-memory database — which makes development and testing much faster and easier. 
      A big focus for us is also learning and practicing unit testing, making sure our application is reliable and that every piece works the way it should. It's a challenging project because we're responsible for designing and building everything — from setting up the architecture to handling things like accounts, transactions, and user management. But it's been a great experience to really understand how a full backend system comes together, especially while collaborating as a small team. <br> <div class='badge-container'>  [![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-java-yellow?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/)[![Vue.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/vue.js-4FC08D?style=for-the-badge&logo=vuedotjs&logoColor=white)]()[![Spring Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spring-6DB33F?style=for-the-badge&logo=spring&logoColor=white)](https://spring.io)[![h2database](https://img.shields.io/badge/h2database-09476B?style=for-the-badge&logo=h2database&logoColor=white)](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) [![Project Status: Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Status-Development-yellow?style=for-the-badge)]() [![Tailwind](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-06B6D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwindcss&logoColor=white)]()</div>"

    image: "/images/projectsPics/kml-project.png"
    content:  "Currently developing a complete e-commerce website for a jewelry business, with a focus on both the customer experience and backend management. On the frontend, i'm using Vue.js and JavaScript to build a responsive, user-friendly interface where customers can browse and purchase products easily, integrating Inspira UI components for a professional look. On the backend, we're working with PHP to handle all the server-side logic. We've integrated the Stripe API to securely manage payments, making the checkout process smooth and reliable. For the admin side, we've built functionality to allow product management, meaning admin can add, update, delete, and organize jewelry listings — as well as track and manage customer orders. The project is giving me a lot of hands-on experience in tying together different parts of a real-world application: frontend design, backend logic, API integration, and building tools for day-to-day business operations. <br> <div class='badge-container'>  [![Vue.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/vue.js-4FC08D?style=for-the-badge&logo=vuedotjs&logoColor=white)]()[![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-777BB4?style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white)]()[![MariaDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/mariadb-003545?style=for-the-badge&logo=mariadb&logoColor=white)]()[![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)]() [![Inspira UI](https://img.shields.io/badge/inspiraUI-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=&logoColor=white)](https://inspira-ui.com) [![Project Status: Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Status-Development-yellow?style=for-the-badge)]()[![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-2496ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)]() [![Nginx](https://img.shields.io/badge/nginx-009639?style=for-the-badge&logo=nginx&logoColor=white)]() [![Tailwind](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-06B6D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwindcss&logoColor=white)]() </div>"

    content:  "Our team of two developed a full website for the Haarlem Festival, starting from the ground up. We began by designing the entire layout and user experience in Figma, making sure the site would be visually appealing and easy to navigate. After finalizing the designs, we moved into development, building the site from scratch using vanilla PHP while following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. This structure helped us keep the project organized and scalable, separating the database logic, user interface, and application control.
