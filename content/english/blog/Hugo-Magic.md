In the vast landscape of website development, the term "static site generator" might sound like a daunting concept for those unfamiliar with the intricacies of web development. However, fear not! Today, we're going to explore Hugo, a static site generator that is not only powerful but also beginner-friendly.

### Understanding Static Sites:
Before delving into Hugo, let's demystify the concept of static sites. Unlike WordPress that generates dynamic websites that fetch data from a server every time a user requests a page, static sites are pre-built and deliver the same content to all users. This simplicity offers several advantages, including faster load times, improved security, and ease of deployment.

### Hugo: The Fast and Flexible Static Site Generator:
Hugo is a static site generator written in Go, designed to be incredibly fast and simple to use. It's an open-source tool that enables users to create websites with ease, making it an excellent choice for developers and non-developers alike. Although you should make your own research about how stuff work for better understandig. Having basic knowledge about HTML/CSS, terminal commands, Github, Netlify, markdown, Visual Studio to edit and create files, would accelerate your procces of deploying a Hugo website.

### Markdown: The Language of Content:
One of Hugo's standout features is its use of Markdown for content creation. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that's easy to learn, even for those with no programming knowledge. It allows users to write content using a simple and readable syntax while Hugo takes care of converting it into HTML, the language that browsers understand. So we can say that Hugo is a compiler for markdown content.

### Why Static? The Benefits of Hugo:

Static sites are easy to deploy, making it a breeze to host your website on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any other hosting provider.

#### Overcoming the Learning Curve:
Now, let's address the elephant in the room â€“ the perceived difficulty for those without programming knowledge. While Hugo is developer-friendly, it doesn't mean non-programmers can't benefit from its capabilities. Hugo has a robust documentation on their own website, there is a big comunity and also YouTube channels that make Hugo tutorials. So getting stuck would be difficult if you are a beginner.

#### Themes:
Hugo offers a variety of themes that you can easily apply to your site without delving into the code. This allows users to have a professionally designed website without writing a single line of code. You can also create your own theme as well, with your own styling, and scripting. That makes it more fun and apports also something to the hugo comunity if you decide to make your theme open source.
