Welcome to the beginning of our nutrition facts web application adventure! It all started with a casual chat with a good friend, a talented UX designer who has been working hard on a personal bigger project for the past six months. While sketching out his grand vision, we stumbled upon a crucial feature that needed attention before his project could fully take flight.

This web application's origin story traces back to a prototype test where we recognized the essential need for a nutrition-focused function. As our friend continues to build his masterpiece from the ground up, we're excited to share how this singular functionality, born from a prototype experiment, has become the heart of our shared journey toward healthier living. Join us as we explore the story of collaboration, innovation, and the creation of a web application with roots in practicality and foresight.

It all started with a simple chat about our friend's need for a nutrient database to power the new features he envisioned. But then, a lightbulb moment hit us â€“ why go through the hassle of building a database from scratch when there are ready-made solutions available through public APIs? We quickly realized that tapping into existing resources not only saves time but also gives us access to a treasure trove of nutritional information. So, we made the decision to harness the efficiency and convenience of public APIs to lay the groundwork for our nutrition facts web application. Little did we know, this small choice would streamline our development process, making our project more dynamic and collaborative than ever before.

In our story, it's important to mention that our friend, the UX designer, is new to the coding world and is teaching himself the ropes. Despite being a beginner, his dedication and passion have played a significant role in his project. As we explored the world of public APIs for our functionality prototype database, his fresh outlook and eagerness to learn became a driving force. It goes to show that innovation knows no boundaries, especially for those diving into the exciting challenges of coding for the first time.

To start things off, I read the instructions provided by the API we wanted to use. With that knowledge in hand, I started putting it into our project, which uses HTML, jQuery, and Tailwind CSS. By following the guidance in the documentation, I connected the API to our web application. This not only showed how handy public APIs can be but also marked the beginning of us working together to bring the UX designer's vision to life through coding


This was the code prived from the API documentation, now it was time to get hands on development for the functionality.

```javascript
var query = '3lb carrots and a chicken sandwich'
$.ajax({
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://api.calorieninjas.com/v1/nutrition?query=' + query,
    headers: { 'X-Api-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'},
    contentType: 'application/json',
    success: function(result) {
        console.log(result);
    },
    error: function ajaxError(jqXHR) {
        console.error('Error: ', jqXHR.responseText);
    }
});
```
